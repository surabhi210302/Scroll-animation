# Scroll-animation
It is a simple scroll animation using HTML and CSS and JavaScript. 

In this webpage we have used a Bunny image with extension .PNG which will be animated then.
for animation we have used various types of libraries such as:
  1) ScrollMagic
  2) addIndicators
  3) animation.gsap
  4) TweenLite
  5) TimelineLite
  6) CSSPlugin
  7) BezierPlugin
Using above libraries and plugin we animate a simpe bunny image along with the scroll.
Here we have used vertical animated bunny, also we can animate it as horizontal by changing the dimensions of X and Y and accordingly bunny will chnage its position.
here bunny directly chnages its position but if we want to change the position in curves the we can add curviness attribute.
until our animation gets completed the pages stops scrolling because we have used a method setpin so it hold the page until animation gets completed if we dont want so then we will simply remove it and page will not hold to animation get completed.

The animation is triggered when scrolling is start.
